# WhatsAgent: Enterprise Multi-Tenant AI WhatsApp Orchestrator 🤖

> **WhatsAgent** is my official submission for the AI Engineer assessment. It is a cloud-native, enterprise-grade, multi-tenant SaaS platform that empowers businesses to deploy autonomous AI support, sales, and knowledge agents directly onto WhatsApp.

This platform goes far beyond a simple wrapper around OpenAI. Built upon **LangGraph**, **Groq (Llama 3.1 & 3.3 Vision)**, and the **Meta WhatsApp Cloud API**, it features a fully asynchronous architecture designed to handle concurrent webhook traffic across hundreds of businesses. It natively executes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) over business catalogs and PDF documents, and provides a stunning, real-time React dashboard for human oversight.

## 🎯 Core Assignment Requirements Met

I approached this assessment with an engineering-first mindset, prioritizing production reliability, state observability, and horizontal scalability. Every single core requirement was meticulously implemented:

1. **True Multi-Tenant Architecture**: A single deployed backend instance can host an infinite number of isolated businesses. The system intelligently routes inbound customer messages to the correct tenant context, brand persona, and vector space simply by evaluating the inbound `whatsapp_phone_number_id`.
2. **Autonomous LangGraph State Machine**: Instead of relying on a naive, unpredictable ReAct loop, inbound text and media are passed through a strict, deterministic 4-node LangGraph pipeline. This drastically reduces LLM hallucination and infinite looping.
3. **Rich Responses & Tool Calling**: The agent does not just output text. It autonomously decides when to trigger tools to query the ChromaDB vector index, attach PDF documents from the Blob store (Media Library), or retrieve product images from the e-commerce catalog.
4. **Real-Time Human Handoff**: The React/Vite dashboard features a live, unified inbox utilizing background database polling. When an agent flags a conversation for escalation, the UI instantly updates, allowing human operators to take over seamlessly.

## 🌟 Bonus Features Implemented (100% Complete)

In addition to the core requirements, all three bonus features were fully engineered and integrated into the primary workflow:

1. **Bonus 1: Webhook Security (X-Hub-Signature-256)**: Exposing a public webhook invites malicious traffic. I implemented cryptographic HMAC SHA-256 validation in the webhook router (`X-Hub-Signature-256`). By comparing a hash generated using the local `META_APP_SECRET` against the hash provided in Meta's request headers, the system mathematically guarantees that payloads genuinely originate from Meta and immediately rejects forged requests with a `403 Forbidden` error.
2. **Bonus 2: Multimodal Inbound Vision**: When a customer sends an image (e.g., a photo of a broken product), the pipeline dynamically intercepts the bytes and passes them to **Groq Llama 3.2 Vision**. The Vision model generates a semantic description of the image, which is instantly injected into the LLM conversational state before the main reasoning node triggers.
3. **Bonus 3: Sentiment & Frustration Escalation**: The LLM's system prompt actively monitors user sentiment. If a user exhibits frustration, anger, or explicitly demands human intervention, the LLM autonomously triggers the `escalate_to_human` tool. This halts all further auto-replies, updates the database enum to `NEEDS_HUMAN`, and flags the conversation red on the dashboard.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack Breakdown

The stack was chosen specifically for low-latency AI messaging and stateless containerized deployment:

* **FastAPI (Python)**: Acts as the core backend router. Chosen for its native asynchronous capabilities and background task offloading, which is critical for surviving Meta's strict webhook timeout windows.
* **LangGraph**: Serves as the AI orchestration layer. Chosen over LangChain's default agents because it allows defining cyclic graphs as deterministic state machines, ensuring the AI never goes off-script.
* **Groq (LPU Inference)**: Powering both text (Llama 3.1 8B) and vision (Llama 3.2 11B). Chosen because WhatsApp users abandon bots if they have to wait 5+ seconds for a reply. Groq's blazing-fast Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) keeps the chat feeling instantaneous.
* **React + Vite + TailwindCSS**: The frontend dashboard stack. Chosen for rapid UI iteration, incredibly fast HMR during development, and minimal bundle sizes for production.
* **MongoDB + GridFS**: The primary operational database. Because LLM memory and LangGraph state can be highly unstructured, a NoSQL document database is superior. GridFS was used to natively store PDF/Image blobs, entirely removing the need for a separate AWS S3 bucket.
* **ChromaDB**: The local vector database. Chosen for its speed and lightweight integration for generating embeddings and performing semantic search on tenant catalogs and PDFs.

### LangGraph Schema: State, Nodes, and Edges

To prevent unpredictable black-box loops, the AI core is built on a deterministic state machine.

#### State Representation (`AgentState`)
The agent's memory for a single execution loop is strictly typed in Python via `TypedDict`. Key components include:
* **Context Identifiers**: `tenant_id` & `session_id`. Used for routing and DB lookups.
* **Inbound Payloads**: `inbound_text` & `inbound_media_type` (raw messages, images, PDFs).
* **Injected Context**: `chat_history` (MongoDB), `rag_chunks` (ChromaDB), and `inbound_image_description` (Groq Vision output).
* **Outbound Generation**: `llm_reply` & `media_to_send` (the final output destined for Meta).
* **Lifecycle Enum**: `session_status` (`WAITING_FOR_BOT`, `AGENT_RESPONDING`, `NEEDS_HUMAN`) controlling human handoff.

#### Nodes and Edges
The graph is designed as a direct pipeline with 4 distinct nodes:

1. **`acknowledge_node`**
   - **Action**: Instantly fires a WhatsApp "Read Receipt" and "Typing..." indicator to reduce user drop-off while the LLM thinks.
   - **Edge**: Flows directly to `context_retriever_node`.
2. **`context_retriever_node`**
   - **Action**: Queries ChromaDB (RAG) based on the customer's text. If the customer sent an image, it halts to query Groq Vision to generate a description.
   - **Edge**: Flows to `llm_reasoning_node`.
3. **`llm_reasoning_node`**
   - **Action**: Assembles a massive context window (Persona + RAG Chunks + Media Availability + Conversation History). Calls Groq for reasoning and tool calling.
   - **Edge**: Flows to `dispatcher_node`.
4. **`dispatcher_node`**
   - **Action**: Executes the final HTTP requests to the Meta API to deliver text and rich media, and saves the outbound audit log to MongoDB.
   - **Edge**: END.

## ⚙️ AI Tool Calling Capabilities

The `llm_reasoning_node` grants the LLM access to specific bound tools, allowing it to interact with the broader system securely:

1. `search_catalog(query: str)`: Executes a vector search against the ChromaDB catalog collection to find matching e-commerce products (with images, prices, and AI-generated descriptions).
2. `get_media(keyword: str)`: Allows the LLM to pull specific PDF brochures, manuals, or images from the MongoDB GridFS media library to attach to the outbound WhatsApp message.
3. `escalate_to_human(reason: str)`: A critical tool that instantly pauses the AI execution pipeline and updates the session status in MongoDB, notifying the human operators on the frontend.

## 🛠️ Key Design Decisions & Trade-offs

During development, several crucial engineering decisions were made to prioritize speed, reliability, and enterprise scale:

1. **FastAPI Background Tasks**: Meta's webhook system strictly demands a `200 OK` response within a few seconds, otherwise it will drop the webhook and retry later. Because LangGraph LLM inference can take 2-4 seconds, processing the webhook synchronously is dangerous. I utilized FastAPI `BackgroundTasks` to instantly respond to Meta, while the LangGraph pipeline executes in a detached async thread.
2. **Idempotency with MongoDB**: Because webhooks can occasionally double-fire over the network, I implemented a `processed_webhooks` collection. By storing every incoming `message_id`, the system performs an atomic check. If a duplicate webhook arrives, it is safely ignored, preventing the LLM from spamming the customer twice.
3. **MongoDB GridFS over AWS S3**: To simplify the deployment footprint and reduce vendor lock-in for this assessment, I opted to use MongoDB GridFS as the primary Blob store for PDF catalogs and customer images. This ensures the backend containers remain entirely stateless and horizontally scalable without needing external S3 buckets.

## 🚀 Quick-Start: Setting up Environment Variables

To run this platform, you will need a Meta Developer Account, a Groq API Key, and a MongoDB instance (local or Atlas).

Create a `.env` file inside the `backend` folder and populate it with the following required variables:

```env
# Database Connections
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/  # Or your MongoDB Atlas URI
MONGO_DB_NAME=whatsapp_agent

# Meta WhatsApp Cloud API (From Facebook Developer Portal)
# NOTE: Ensure your personal phone number is added to the "To" field in Meta's API setup!
META_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your_phone_number_id
META_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_permanent_or_temporary_access_token
META_VERIFY_TOKEN=your_custom_verify_string  # You make this up (e.g. whatsagent@123)
META_APP_SECRET=your_app_secret  # Required for X-Hub-Signature-256 Webhook Security

# AI Models (Fast & Free Tier via Groq)
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_groq_key
GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.1-8b-instant

# System Settings
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_dashboard_password
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

## 💻 Step-by-Step Instructions to Run Locally

### 1. Run the Backend (FastAPI)
The backend is a FastAPI server that handles Meta webhooks, processes the LangGraph pipeline, and hosts the API for the dashboard.

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the uvicorn development server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
*The API and Swagger documentation will be available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`*

### 2. Run the Frontend Dashboard (React + Vite)
The frontend is a React Single Page Application (SPA) styled with TailwindCSS.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install

# Create a local .env file pointing to your backend
echo "VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000" > .env

# Start the Vite development server
npm run dev
```
*The SaaS dashboard will be available at `http://localhost:5173`. Log in using the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` defined in your backend `.env`.*

## 🌍 Chosen Deployment Environment & Setup Details

For production, the application is intentionally designed to be deployed as separated microservices to ensure stability and horizontal scalability.

### 1. Backend (FastAPI via Render / Railway)
The backend requires a persistent environment to execute background tasks reliably and maintain ChromaDB vector bindings.
- **Hosting**: Render Web Service (Python) or a Railway Docker deployment.
- **Start Command**: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
- **Networking Requirement**: The backend URL MUST be exposed to the public internet using HTTPS so that Meta's servers can deliver webhook POST requests to `/api/webhooks/whatsapp`.

### 2. Frontend (Vite SPA via Vercel / Netlify)
The frontend is purely static HTML/JS/CSS once built, making edge-network deployment optimal for low-latency dashboard loads.
- **Hosting**: Vercel or Netlify.
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Setup Detail**: During the deployment build step on Vercel, the `VITE_API_BASE_URL` Environment Variable MUST be set to the production URL of the deployed FastAPI backend (e.g. `https://my-backend-render.com`).

### 3. Database (MongoDB Atlas)
- **Hosting**: MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted MongoDB).
- **Design Choice**: Utilizing a centralized cloud database allows for horizontal scaling of the backend workers. If traffic spikes, Render can spin up 5 backend instances, and they will all seamlessly share state via Atlas and GridFS.

### 4. Meta Webhook Configuration (Going Live)
Once deployed, the Meta portal must be configured to point to the live server:
1. Navigate to **WhatsApp > Configuration** in the Meta Developer Portal.
2. Click Edit next to Webhook.
3. Set the Callback URL to `https://<your-deployed-backend-url>/api/webhooks/whatsapp`.
4. Set the Verify Token to match the `META_VERIFY_TOKEN` you placed in your Render environment variables.
5. Under "Webhook fields", click **Manage** and subscribe strictly to the **messages** event.
